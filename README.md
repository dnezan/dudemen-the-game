# Dudemen: The Game
 A pixel art sidescroller featuring the DudeMen, a group of 7 mortals who must fight a great evil.
 
 # Plan/Outline ( For Now )
1) Character designs and Mannerisms/Behaviour - let's design a system where each dudemen can contribute to his character design

2) Story - are we saving the word? Are we in mvm? Are we in college? Do we include both? Is it a normal life scenario ? 

3) Type of the game - adventure, adventure with combat, point and click adventure, adventure with RPG elements

4) View - isometric, side scroller or top view or a combination of all
